This is my Work Day Scheduler, made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript!

The purpose of this project is to have the user log in their schedule for the work day. When they enter their day, after pressing the save button it'll save that data to a local storage.

This is how the present looks. When it is present, it'll be red to show that this should take prioity.

This is how the past looks. When it is past, it'll be gray to show that this is done and should be finished.

This is how the future looks. When it is future, it'll be green to show that this is coming up. However, it isn't a prioity.
